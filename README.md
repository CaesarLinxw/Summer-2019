Developed several robot projects that run in the ROS Gazebo simulation environment, including an obstacle-avoiding robot with sensor fusion, a maze-solving robot using flood-fill/A-star algorithms, and a line-following robot with sensor fusion and vision.

For the first two projects, I used the turtlebot existed in the Gazebo environment. Then I developed a simple robot model using XML to implement the line-following robot.
